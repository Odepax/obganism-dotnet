map of int, string )

position: 19
message: "An object list must end with the end of the input."

// 'string' is considered as a second object.
//
// It will stop parsing the type name, encounter the ')',
// which is not a '{' => no properties,
// which is not a '--' => no modifiers,
// so it will stop parsing the 'string' object.
//
// It will try to parse further, but ')' isn't a break,
// so, it will declare the end of the object list,
// but it's not the end of the input...
